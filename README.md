# Energy Demand Forecasting with Streamlit

This project demonstrates how to use Streamlit to create a web application for forecasting energy demand of Turkey using machine learning techniques. The application loads a pre-trained machine learning model and allows users to input parameters such as hour, day of the week, and month to predict energy demand.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    https://github.com/glider024/Forecasting-demands.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:

    ```bash
    streamlit run appp.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8503` to access the Streamlit app.

3. Use the slider to input the parameters for hour, day of the week, and month.

4. The app will display the predicted energy demand based on the input parameters.
